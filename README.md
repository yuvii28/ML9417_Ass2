Challenge, training with the training set and writing out results after predicting the competition set. 
Writes results to result.csv in the format: Headline,Body ID,Stance.

###Validate.py
Helper python script that also trains the classifer on the training data but then performs 10-fold validation to validate 
our methods and increase accuracy between different optimisations.

Script provided by Fake News Challenge that takes a test set and your results and returns the accuracy and a score. 
Usage: python scorer.py competition_test_stances.csv results.csv
Where results.csv is generated by runnnig FakeNewsChallenge.py above.
